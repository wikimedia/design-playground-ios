# iOS Design Playground

A playground of various standard UI elements, fonts, and colors. You can use the [Environment Overrides](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/xcode-11-environmental-overrides/) in Xcode to change things like Dynamic Type size and Light/Dark appearance to see how the UI elements react. Use the Playground tab to create some customized common UIKit elements.

The colors and text styles presented in the app are the system available ones from iOS 14+ (for example, the [systemMint](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/3852741-systemmint) color is only available in iOS 15+ and not included here).

## Running

`Design Playground` requires Xcode and supports devices and simulators running iOS 14.5+.

1. Open the `Design Playground.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
2. Choose a Simulator or device and click the Run icon or use the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜-R`.
3. Search for `// NOTE:` in the code to find UI elements that you can change the properties of to experiment.
